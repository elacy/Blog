A spokesman and member of parliament for Golden Dawn, a far far right (neo nazi) party in Greece assaulted another member of parliament on national TV. I wonder if the kind of people who voted for this kind of person will change how they vote after seeing this. Perhaps it will simply effect who Golden Dawn can go into government with. A lot will depend on how the party leadership handle this incident. I expect they will attempt to down play it, make excuses and shift the blame, however anything less than a full apology and firing the spokesman would be disgusting even if unsurprising.
