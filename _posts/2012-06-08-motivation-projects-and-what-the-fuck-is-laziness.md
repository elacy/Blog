I have a technical book that will help me in my career sitting on my book shelf gathering dust. I was able to get through a similar book before, one chapter a day but for some reason I find this book far more intimidating.  
I imagine that once I actually pick it up for the second time it will be a lot easier given I know more about the subject than I did when I first picked it up, but Iâ€™m lazy.

I donâ€™t know what laziness is but for some reason thatâ€™s what I am. I feel lazy, meaning that instead of doing what I need to do to advance my career and also something I want to do because to me this subject is fascinating, Iâ€™m going to spend an evening starting a new blog, talking with friends and watching an episode of Hit & Miss (Iâ€™ll talk about this later).

My flatmate has a theory, he says that laziness is an expression of fear. I suppose itâ€™s similar to my deer in headlights reaction when Iâ€™m put on the spot, my first reaction is to freeze up and try to hide, behind a computer screen if possible.

This isnâ€™t working though, Iâ€™m going to have to deal with this, because Iâ€™m itching to make a difference, I want to influence this world and what I can do when Iâ€™m hiding just isnâ€™t enough. I expect more from myself, always, but I always like to keep the distance in check.

Iâ€™ll admit Iâ€™m doing quite well though, only because Iâ€™m at the beginning of one of the most momentous changes in my life. Confirming my gender.

OK Iâ€™m going to finish this post off with an explanation of the profanity in the title. Iâ€™m a bit of pedant when it comes to language, someone describing a depressed person as lazy drives me up the wall. It makes me want to start a paramilitary force for the accurate naming of things. The profanity helps you, the reader understand that this is an emotionally charged issue for me, the author.
